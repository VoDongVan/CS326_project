            <h3>Rubens Nherisson</h3>
            <p>I am a motivated student and studying Computer Science, 
            and am currently a junior. I have had an interest in Computer 
            Science since discovering it in high school, and have a passion for learning
             as much as I can about the field. I currently spend most of my time learning through school 
             work and assignments, but I have not currently built a full-stack project on my own yet-
              only as a team. I am familiar with programming languages such as Java, JavaScript/TypeScript,
               Python, and C/C++, but I am most comfortable with JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python.
        I also am familiar with Node.js, along with Express.js for
         backend development. I have also familiarized
        myself with Mongoose and a little bit of Prisma for 
        databases, using MongoDB. For the front-end, 
         I am only a little familiar with React, 
         but will strive to learn more. </p>

            <h3>Zih Nche</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Zih and I am a junior majoring in Informatics. I have experiences with programming languages such as Python, Java, Javascript, and R. My favorite would have to be R! In a previous course titled Info 101 (The introduction to informatics), I worked on a web development project where my group incorporated HTML. Iâ€™m interested in web development/application and practicing more of it this semester as well as the rest of my time at UMass.

            <p>I am a Junior in Computer Science. I have experience in Java, Javascript, C++ and Python. I know a little bit about web development, but I have never worked on frontend. I have some experience with backend, MySQL, Spring Boot from CS 320 course. Through this course, I hope that I will become familiar with frontend stuff and sharpen my backend skills.

            <h3>Quan Vo</h3>
            <p>I am a junior in Computer Science. Aside from what we learn in this course(HTML/CSS, Node.JS), I know Java, Javascript, Python, C/C++ and have used SpringBoot framework before. I also have used PostGreSQL, but nothing too advanced. I have some experience with building a web application on the backend side from my previous course. Currently, I am also learning more about Node.JS, React, and MongoDB by myself, but I am not exactly really good at them yet. I am hoping that I will gain more experience in both front-end and back-end stuff from this course.

        <section id="data-requirements">
            <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
            <p>Our web application relies on various types of data to deliver its functionalities effectively. In this section, we outline the primary data categories our application handles, each playing a crucial role in ensuring seamless user experiences and robust functionality.

                Our application primarily deals with user-generated data, which includes information provided directly by users during their interactions with the platform. This encompasses user profiles, preferences, and activity logs. By capturing and storing this data, we can personalize user experiences, tailor content recommendations, and track user engagement to improve the overall usability of the application.
                
                Another vital aspect of our data requirements is content data. This encompasses a wide range of multimedia content such as quizzes, questions, answers, and educational materials. Managing content data effectively is essential for delivering relevant and engaging learning experiences to our users. Additionally, metadata associated with content, such as tags, categories, and ratings, enables efficient content organization and retrieval, enhancing user accessibility and searchability.
                
                In addition to user-generated and content data, our application also handles session data. This includes information related to quiz sessions, such as session duration, participant responses, and performance metrics. By collecting and analyzing session data, we can evaluate the effectiveness of quizzes, identify areas for improvement, and tailor future sessions to better meet user needs and learning objectives.
                
                Lastly, our application may also integrate with external data sources to enrich the user experience and provide additional functionalities. This may include integration with educational databases, learning management systems, or third-party APIs to access supplementary learning resources, retrieve real-time data, or enhance content recommendations. Leveraging external data sources allows us to expand the breadth and depth of our application's offerings, providing users with comprehensive learning experiences.
                
                In conclusion, our web application relies on various types of data to deliver personalized, engaging, and effective learning experiences to our users. From user-generated data to content data, session data, and external data sources, each data category plays a vital role in shaping the functionality and usability of our application. By effectively managing and leveraging these data types, we can continuously enhance the quality and relevance of our platform, empowering users to achieve their learning goals efficiently.

            <h2>Real Word Examples</h2>
            <p>In today's rapidly evolving educational landscape, traditional methods often struggle to engage learners effectively and provide personalized support. Our web application offers a dynamic solution by leveraging proximity-based technologies to create interactive and collaborative learning experiences. By utilizing Bluetooth or QR codes, participants in physical proximity can seamlessly join quizzes and activities, fostering engagement and collaboration.

                Imagine a classroom where educators are using iClickers to conduct quizzes and track attendance. With our application, educators can replace iClickers with a more efficient and versatile solution. By utilizing Bluetooth or QR codes, students can easily join quiz sessions and participate in activities simply by being in the classroom. This streamlines the process of conducting quizzes and eliminates the need for additional hardware, such as iClickers.
                
                Moreover, our application offers features beyond traditional iClickers by providing real-time attendance tracking. As students join quiz sessions using their mobile devices, their attendance is automatically recorded, providing educators with accurate attendance data without manual effort.
                
                By addressing the real-world issue of disengagement in traditional learning environments and providing a modern alternative to tools like iClickers, our web application offers a transformative solution that empowers educators and enhances the learning experience for students. Through interactive and collaborative experiences, we aim to revolutionize education and inspire a lifelong passion for learning.
